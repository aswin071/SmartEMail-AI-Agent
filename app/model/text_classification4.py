TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which is a commonly used method for text classification tasks.
The TF-IDF Vectorizer converts the text data into numerical vectors, which the machine learning model can use to identify patterns.

-definition :TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a method that highlights important words based 
on how frequently they appear in a document versus across all documents, improving the modelâ€™s ability to identify relevant features.
